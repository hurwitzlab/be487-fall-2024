# Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, dpi = 120)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '/xdisk/bhurwitz/bh_class/YOUR_NETID/exercises/16_beta_diversity_2') # Change your NETID
```

```{bash, engine.opts='-l'}
# Let's make it so R can find the fonts we need
export FONTCONFIG_PATH=/etc/fonts
```
```{r}
dyn.load("/opt/ohpc/pub/apps/libpng/1.6.37/lib/libpng16.so.16")
```

```{r message=FALSE}
library(seriation)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(phyloseq)
library(microViz)
library(shiny)
```

```{r}
shao19 <- readRDS('/xdisk/bhurwitz/bh_class/data/microviz/shao19.rds')
```


# Beta diversity (part 2)

## Dissimilarity measures

What are we doing?
Calculating the dissimilarity of two samples' compositions.
We talked about these dissimilarity measures in the lecture.

-   Binary Jaccard - presence-absence only
-   Bray-Curtis - abundance weighted
-   UniFrac distances (unweighted, weighted, generalised)

To simplify and speed up the analyses, we're going to take a smaller part of the dataset.
We'll only look at the 300 infant fecal samples from 4 days of age.

```{r}
shao4 <- shao19 %>% ps_filter(family_role == "child", infant_age == 4)
```

We're going to filter out rare taxa quite strictly, for similar reasons.
But we won't overwrite our smaller dataset: we'll do the filtering per analysis.

```{r}
shao4 %>%
  tax_filter(min_prevalence = 2.5 / 100) %>%
  tax_agg(rank = "genus") %>%
  tax_transform("binary") %>% # converts counts to absence/presence: 0/1
  dist_calc(dist = "jaccard")
```

So we get our pairwise dissimilarities, in a distance matrix 
attached as an extra part on the original phyloseq object, as part of a container object 
(a "ps_extra" class object created by microViz, which also stores info about the aggregation and transformations you performed)

```{r}
distances <- shao4 %>%
  tax_filter(min_prevalence = 2.5 / 100, verbose = FALSE) %>%
  tax_agg(rank = "genus") %>%
  tax_transform("binary") %>%
  dist_calc(dist = "jaccard") %>%
  dist_get()
```

You can extract the dissimilarities or distances with dist_get. 

```{r}
as.matrix(distances)[1:5, 1:5]
```

The Binary Jaccard dissimilarities range between zero (identical) and one (no shared genera).

```{r}
range(distances)
```


# Session info

Records your package versions etc.
Useful for debugging / reproducing analysis.

```{r}
devtools::session_info()
