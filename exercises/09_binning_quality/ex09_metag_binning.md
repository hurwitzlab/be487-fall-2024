# Metagenome Binning

### Questions:
- How can we obtain the original genomes from a metagenome?
### Objectives: 
- Obtain Metagenome-Assembled Genomes from the metagenomic assembly. 
### Keypoints:
- Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) sometimes are obtained from curated contigs grouped into bins.
- Use MAXBIN to assign the contigs to bins of different taxa.


## Metagenomic binning  
Contigs in the assembly can be separated into bins with a process called binning. This process allows for a separate analysis of each species contained in the metagenome with enough reads to reconstruct a genome. Genomes reconstructed from metagenomic assemblies are called MAGs (Metagenome-Assembled Genomes).
In this process, the assembled contigs from the metagenome will be assigned to different bins (FASTA files that contain certain contigs). Ideally, each bin corresponds to only one original genome (a MAG).

An obvious way to separate contigs that correspond to a different species is by their taxonomic assignation, but 
there are more reliable methods that do the binning using 
characteristics of the contigs, such as their GC content, the use of tetranucleotides (composition), or their coverage (abundance).

[Maxbin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxbin/files/) is a binning algorithm 
that distinguishes between contigs that belong to different bins according to their 
coverage levels and the tetranucleotide frequencies they have.

None, because 18,412 reads of 150bp gives a total count of 2,761,800 bp (~2Mbp). Even if no read maps to the same region, the amount of base pairs is less than the size of a bacterial genome. A “typical” bacterial genome is around 5 million bp.

Let's bin the samples we assembled. The command for running MaxBin is `run_MaxBin.pl`, and the arguments it needs are the FASTA file of the assembly, the FASTQ with the forward and reverse reads, the output directory, and the name. 

Let's get started.

```
$ interactive
$ cd /xdisk/bhurwitz/bh_class/bonnie/exercises/08_assembly/assembly_JC1A
$ mkdir ../../09_metag_binning/assembly_JC1A
$ /contrib/singularity/shared/bhurwitz/maxbin2:2.2.7--hdbdd923_5.sif run_MaxBin.pl \
-thread 8 -contig JC1A_contigs.fasta \
-reads ../../06_qc_trimming/JC1A_R1.trim.fastq.gz \
-reads2 ../../06_qc_trimming/JC1A_R2.trim.fastq.gz \
-out ../../09_metag_binning/assembly_JC1A
$ mv ../../09_metag_binning/assembly_JC1A.* ../../09_metag_binning/assembly_JC1A
```

```

```

Oh No! It's impossible to bin our assembly because the number of marker genes is less than 1. 
We could have expected this as we know it is a small sample.

Let's try this on another sample that is bigger.

We will perform the binning process with the other sample from the same study that is larger. We have the assembly precomputed in the `/xdisk/bhurwitz/bh_class/mags/` directory that you can copy over and use.

```
$ cd ..
$ mkdir assembly_JP4D
$ cd assembly_JP4D
$ cp /xdisk/bhurwitz/bh_class/mags/JP4D_contigs.fasta .
$ mkdir ../../09_metag_binning/assembly_JP4D
$ /contrib/singularity/shared/bhurwitz/maxbin2:2.2.7--hdbdd923_5.sif run_MaxBin.pl \
-thread 8 -contig JP4D_contigs.fasta \
-reads ../../06_qc_trimming/JP4D_R1.trim.fastq.gz \
-reads2 ../../06_qc_trimming/JP4D_R2.trim.fastq.gz \
-out ../../09_metag_binning/assembly_JP4D
```

It will take ~7 min minutes to run. Moreover, it will finish with an output like this:

```
========== Job finished ==========

```

With the `.summary` file, we can quickly look at the bins that MaxBin produced. First we will move all of the files into the assembly_JP4D directory.

```
$ ../../09_metag_binning/
$ mv assembly_JP4D.* assembly_JP4D
$ cat ./assembly_JP4D/assembly_JP4D.summary
```

```
