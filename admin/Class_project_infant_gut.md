The c-section vs c-section + FMT is possible, but note that the FMT trial was not part of the HELMi cohort (hence the time points will not match).
I would suggest the following:
1: Effect of birth mode over time on the taxonomy (in particular look at Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium)
2: Strain stability in the infant gut (rather than looking at mother-infant transmission, look at how stable the strain is in one individual during infancy, you'll see that after 6months a lot of early life-strains will be lost)
3: ARG dynamics during infancy - or any other functional change like carbohydrate degradation

You could also do Vaginal delivery vs Vaginal delivery + Intrapartum Antibiotics. You won't see a lot of effect of the IA on the infant microbiota, but it was an important question to address, and we released that metadata with the samples. (edited)

So the PRJEB64567 project is the FMT trial, not the HELMi cohort
The HELMi datasets are available here PRJEB52774 (MiSeq runs) and PRJEB70237 (MGI sequencing platform). The time points are a bit different between the two sequencing datasets, but both are ok for the projects I listed above
