# The Infant Gut Microbiome Develpment

## Three Projects on the Infant Gut Microbiome.

1: Effect of birth mode over time on the taxonomy (in particular look at Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium)

2: Strain stability in the infant gut (in particular, look at how stable a strain is in one individual during infancy, you'll see that after 6 months a lot of early life-strains will be lost!)

3: Antibiotic Resistance Gene (ARG) dynamics during infancy - or any other functional change like carbohydrate degradation

The HELMi datasets are available in PRJEB52774 (MiSeq runs) and PRJEB70237 (MGI sequencing platform). The time points are a bit different between the two sequencing datasets, but both are ok for the projects I listed above.
