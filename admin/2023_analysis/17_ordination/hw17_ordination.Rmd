# Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Change your NETID
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, dpi = 120)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '/xdisk/bhurwitz/bh_class/NETID/assignments/17_ordination')
```

```{bash, engine.opts='-l'}
# Let's make it so R can find the fonts we need
export FONTCONFIG_PATH=/etc/fonts
```

```{r}
dyn.load("/opt/ohpc/pub/apps/libpng/1.6.37/lib/libpng16.so.16")
```

```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r message=FALSE}
library(seriation)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(phyloseq)
library(microViz)
library(shiny)
```

## Importing and fixing taxa your FMT dataset

To get started, we need to import our set.biom file into R and work with it using the phyloseq package

```{r}
# replace your NETID and SETID here, for example set21.biom
fmt <- import_biom("/xdisk/bhurwitz/bh_class/NETID/assignments/12_phyloseq/SETID.biom")
```

### Fixing tax_table

Let's format the dataset.

```{r}
fmt@tax_table@.Data <- substring(fmt@tax_table@.Data, 4)
colnames(fmt@tax_table@.Data)<- c("kingdom", "phylum", "class", "order", "family", "genus", "species")
fmt <- tax_fix(fmt, verbose = FALSE)
```


## Ordination

Ordination refers to the process of ordering things (in our case: samples), so that similar things (samples) are closer to each other, 
and dissimilar things (samples) are further away.

### PCoA

Let's get started with a Principal Co-ordinates Analysis.

Takes distance matrix and finds new dimensions (a co-ordinate system if you like).
The new dimensions are created with the aim to preserve the original distances between samples, 
but to capture the majority of this distance information in the first few dimensions.
We like this because it makes it easier to visualize the patterns in your data (in 2D or 3D).

```{r}
fmt %>%
  tax_filter(min_prevalence = 2.5 / 100, verbose = FALSE) %>%
  tax_agg(rank = "genus") %>%
  dist_calc(dist = "bray") %>%
  ord_calc(method = "PCoA") %>%
  ord_plot(alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  theme_classic(12) +
  coord_fixed(0.7)
```

Next, let's color each sample according to its dominant (most abundant) genus.

```{r}
fmt %>%
  tax_filter(min_prevalence = 2.5 / 100, verbose = FALSE) %>%
  ps_calc_dominant(rank = "genus", none = "Mixed", other = "Other") %>%
  tax_agg(rank = "genus") %>%
  dist_calc(dist = "bray") %>%
  ord_calc(method = "PCoA") %>%
  ord_plot(color = "dominant_genus", alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(name = "Dominant Genus", palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_classic(12) +
  coord_fixed(0.7)
```

## PERMANOVA:

Permutational multivariate analysis of variance.

-   ANOVA - analysis of variance (statistical modelling approach)
-   Multivariate - more than one dependent variable (multiple taxa!)
-   Permutational - statistical significance estimates obtained by shuffling the data many times

**TLDR:** Are those groups on the PCoA actually different??

```{r}
fmt %>%
  tax_filter(min_prevalence = 2.5 / 100, verbose = FALSE) %>%
  tax_agg(rank = "genus") %>%
  dist_calc(dist = "bray") %>%
  ord_calc(method = "PCoA") %>%
  ord_plot(alpha = 0.6, size = 2, color = "type") +
  theme_classic(12) +
  coord_fixed(0.7) +
  stat_ellipse(aes(color = type)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

```{r}
fmt %>%
  tax_filter(min_prevalence = 2.5 / 100, verbose = FALSE) %>%
  tax_agg(rank = "genus") %>%
  dist_calc(dist = "bray") %>%
  dist_permanova(variables = "type", n_perms = 99, seed = 123) %>%
  perm_get()
# Use more permutations for a more reliable p.value in your real work (slower)
# Set a random seed number for reproducibility of this stochastic method
```

Is the model output for the p value, Pr(\>F) below 0.05? If so, this indicates that there is good statistical evidence 
that the bacterial gut microbiota composition of donors is different from recipients. 

You should also report that you used Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, calculated on genera.
(after keeping only unique taxa with a prevalence of at least 2.5%!)

It's probably a good idea to decide on a couple of appropriate distance measures up front for these tests, 
and report both (at least in supplementary material), as the choice of distance measure can affect results and conclusions!

You can also adjust for covariates in PERMANOVA, and often should, depending on your study design.
Let's fit a more complex model, adjusting for whether the c. diff infection was resolved, the health of the recipient,
and the total number of reads in the sample.

```{r}
fmt %>%
  tax_filter(min_prevalence = 2.5 / 100, verbose = FALSE) %>%
  tax_agg(rank = "genus") %>%
  dist_calc(dist = "bray") %>%
  dist_permanova(
    variables = c("type", "ssx_resolved", "health"),
    n_perms = 99, seed = 111
  ) %>%
  perm_get()
# Use more permutations for a more reliable p.value in your real work (slower)
# Set a random seed number for reproducibility of this stochastic method
```


Copy your notebook into the current working directory. Be sure to change to your NETID.

Also, take a minute to "knit" the Rmd notebook into word, and submit this on D2L. Note that this will become useful later for your report, when you select a few graphs to include.

```{bash, engine.opts='-l'}
# copy your notebook into the working directory
cp ~/hw17_ordination.Rmd /xdisk/bhurwitz/bh_class/YOUR_NETID/assignments/17_ordination
```

# Session info

Records your package versions etc.
Useful for debugging / reproducing analysis.

```{r}
devtools::session_info()
```
