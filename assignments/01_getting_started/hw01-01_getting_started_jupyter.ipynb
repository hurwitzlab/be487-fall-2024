The Jupyter notebook combines two components:\n",
    "A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.\n",

In this way, notebook files can serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich representations of resulting objects. These documents are internally [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files and are saved with the .ipynb extension. Since JSON is a plain text format, they can be version-controlled and shared with colleagues."

A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be executed by using Shift-Enter, or by clicking either the “Play” button the toolbar, or Cell, Run in the menu bar. The execution behavior of a cell is determined by the cell’s type. There are three types of cells: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells. Every cell starts off being a code cell, but its type can be changed by using a drop-down on the toolbar (which will be “Code”, initially), or via [keyboard shortcuts](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#keyboard-shortcuts)."

The results that are returned from this computation are then displayed in the notebook as the cell’s output.

    "Typically, you will work on a computational problem in pieces, organizing related ideas into cells and moving forward once previous parts work correctly. This is much more convenient for interactive exploration than breaking up a computation into scripts that must be executed together, as was previously necessary, especially if parts of them take a long time to run.\n",
