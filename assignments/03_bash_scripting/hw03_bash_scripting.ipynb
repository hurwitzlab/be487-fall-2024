You can manage with 1-3 positional arguments, but, after that, we really need to have named arguments and/or flags to indicate how we want to run the program.  A named argument might be `-f mouse.fa` to indicate the value for the `-f` \\(\"file,\" probably\\) argument is \"mouse.fa,\" whereas a flag like `-v` might be a yes/no \\(\"Boolean,\" if you like\\) indicator that we do or do not want \"verbose\" mode.  You've encountered these with programs like `ls -l` to indicate you want the \"long\" directory listing or `ps -u $USER` to indicate the value for `-u` is the `$USER`.\n",
